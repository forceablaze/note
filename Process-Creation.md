### Process
Processes are, however, more than just the executing program code (often called the text section in Unix).They also include a set of resources such as open files and pending signals, internal kernel data, processor state, a memory address space with one or more memory mappings, one or more threads of execution, and a data section containing global variables. 
Processes, in effect, are the living result of running program code.The kernel needs to manage all these details efficiently and transparently. Threads of execution, often shortened to thread
