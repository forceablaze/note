### MMU
	 the hardware that manages memory and performs virtual to physical address
translations

### Page
page 是系統管理記憶體的最小單位，
Linux 將實體記憶體全部劃分為許多 page。
大多系統的 page size 為 4K

#ifdef __ASSEMBLY__

#else
#define PAGE_SIZE	(1UL << PAGE_SHIFT)
#endif
#define PAGE_MASK	(~(PAGE_SIZE-1))
```

 * Each physical page in the system has a struct page associated with
 * it to keep track of whatever it is we are using the page for at the
 * moment. Note that we have no way to track which tasks are using
 * a page, though if it is a pagecache page, rmap structures can tell us
 * who is mapping it.
 *
 * The objects in struct page are organized in double word blocks in
 * order to allows us to use atomic double word operations on portions
 * of struct page. That is currently only used by slub but the arrangement
 * allows the use of atomic double word operations on the flags/mapping

page 有個 flag 來表示狀態

linux/page-flags.h
``` c
/*
 * Various page->flags bits:
 *
 * PG_reserved is set for special pages, which can never be swapped out. Some
 * of them might not even exist (eg empty_bad_page)...
 *
 * The PG_private bitflag is set on pagecache pages if they contain filesystem
 * specific data (which is normally at page->private). It can be used by
 * private allocations for its own usage.
 *
 * During initiation of disk I/O, PG_locked is set. This bit is set before I/O
 * and cleared when writeback _starts_ or when read _completes_. PG_writeback
 * is set before writeback starts and cleared when it finishes.
 *
 * PG_locked also pins a page in pagecache, and blocks truncation of the file
 * while it is held.
 *
 * page_waitqueue(page) is a wait queue of all tasks waiting for the page
 * to become unlocked.
 *
 * PG_uptodate tells whether the page's contents is valid.  When a read
 * completes, the page becomes uptodate, unless a disk I/O error happened.
 *
 * PG_referenced, PG_reclaim are used for page reclaim for anonymous and
 * file-backed pagecache (see mm/vmscan.c).
 *
 * PG_error is set to indicate that an I/O error occurred on this page.
 *
 * PG_arch_1 is an architecture specific page state bit.  The generic code
 * guarantees that this bit is cleared for a page when it first is entered into
 * the page cache.
 *
 * PG_highmem pages are not permanently mapped into the kernel virtual address
 * space, they need to be kmapped separately for doing IO on the pages.  The
 * struct page (these bits with information) are always mapped into kernel
 * address space...
 *
 * PG_hwpoison indicates that a page got corrupted in hardware and contains
 * data with incorrect ECC bits that triggered a machine check. Accessing is
 * not safe since it may cause another machine check. Don't touch!
 */

/*
 * Don't use the *_dontuse flags.  Use the macros.  Otherwise you'll break
 * locked- and dirty-page accounting.
 *
 * The page flags field is split into two parts, the main flags area
 * which extends from the low bits upwards, and the fields area which
 * extends from the high bits downwards.
 *
 *  | FIELD | ... | FLAGS |
 *  N-1           ^       0
 *               (NR_PAGEFLAGS)
 *
 * The fields area is reserved for fields mapping zone, node (for NUMA) and
 * SPARSEMEM section (for variants of SPARSEMEM that require section ids like
 * SPARSEMEM_EXTREME with !SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP).

```
atomic_t _count 計算該 page 的 usage count
這個counter不能直接讀取，要透過 page_count()

linux/mm.h
``` c
static inline int page_count(struct page *page)
{
	return atomic_read(&compound_head(page)->_count);
}
```

void *virtual 則是 page的 virtual memory address
但是有些 page 不會一直 mapping 到 kernel，此時 virtual = NULL


### Zones

+ ZONE_DMA
This zone contains pages that can undergo DMA.
+ ZONE_DMA_32
Like ZOME_DMA, this zone contains pages that can undergo DMA.
Unlike ZONE_DMA, these pages are accessible only by 32-bit devices. On some architectures,
this zone is a larger subset of memory.
+ ZONE_NORMAL
This zone contains normal, regularly mapped, pages.
+ ZONE_HIGHMEM
This zone contains “high memory,” which are pages not permanently
mapped into the kernel’s address space.

linux/mmzone.h
``` c
enum zone_type {
#ifdef CONFIG_ZONE_DMA
	/*
	 * ZONE_DMA is used when there are devices that are not able
	 * to do DMA to all of addressable memory (ZONE_NORMAL). Then we
	 * carve out the portion of memory that is needed for these devices.
	 * The range is arch specific.
	 *
	 * Some examples
	 *
	 * Architecture		Limit
	 * ---------------------------
	 * parisc, ia64, sparc	<4G
	 * s390			<2G
	 * arm			Various
	 * alpha		Unlimited or 0-16MB.
	 *
	 * i386, x86_64 and multiple other arches
	 * 			<16M.
	 */
	ZONE_DMA,
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32
	/*
	 * x86_64 needs two ZONE_DMAs because it supports devices that are
	 * only able to do DMA to the lower 16M but also 32 bit devices that
	 * can only do DMA areas below 4G.
	 */
	ZONE_DMA32,
#endif
	/*
	 * Normal addressable memory is in ZONE_NORMAL. DMA operations can be
	 * performed on pages in ZONE_NORMAL if the DMA devices support
	 * transfers to all addressable memory.
	 */
	ZONE_NORMAL,
#ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM
	/*
	 * A memory area that is only addressable by the kernel through
	 * mapping portions into its own address space. This is for example
	 * used by i386 to allow the kernel to address the memory beyond
	 * 900MB. The kernel will set up special mappings (page
	 * table entries on i386) for each page that the kernel needs to
	 * access.
	 */
	ZONE_HIGHMEM,
#endif
	ZONE_MOVABLE,
	__MAX_NR_ZONES
};

```
Zone Description Physical Memory
ZONE_DMA DMA-able pages < 16MB
ZONE_NORMAL Normally addressable pages 16–896MB
ZONE_HIGHMEM Dynamically mapped pages > 896MB
